# ESP32-SPL
Sound Level Meter using NodeMcu ESP-32s V1.1 
and MAX9814 sound sensor amplifier with a CMA-4544PF-W microphone,
display dBSPL value on 128x32 OLED screen and sending these data t a
MQTT broker (ThingSpeak)

Done the coding using VSC with PlatformIO build tool to install
arduino libraries faster and connect to the microcontroller, also
it makes the project more transparent. I'm using Arduino language which is
an extension for C++ language.
